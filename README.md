##Makes an AV install a demo box for fun and potential profit

This will add named assets with properties, logged in users, netflow, vulnerability scan, and more....

demo. demo. Dance!

This is a clone of the collaborative repository created by PacketInspector and Santiago Bassett, with the addition of a few Sonicwall events, and Cisco ASA events, used in writing a SANS gold paper: OSSIM: CIS Critical Security Controls Assessment in a Windows Environment.  I do hope to add some OSSEC events as time permits.  Many thanks to Joe and Santi for their great work on these scripts!

The original Alienvault-Demo_scripts repo is here:  https://github.com/santiago-bassett/Alienvault-Demo_scripts

####To install:

```
git clone https://github.com/kgeil/Alienvault-Demo_scripts
cd Alienvault-Demo
perl install.pl
```
####Fast Install:
```
apt-get -y install git;git clone https://github.com/kgeil/Alienvault-Demo_scripts;cd Alienvault-Demo_scripts ; perl install.pl; sonicwall/convert_sonicwall.sh; ossecwin/brutewin.sh
#the convert_sonicwall.sh script just changes the date on sonicwall events to today().  If I have the time, I hope to figure out why Santiago Basset's read_sonicwall.sh script isn't working with my data.  I think it needs to run through the clean_logs function in runlogs.pl, but I need to finish editing this paper and get it out the door first...
```

The script will do all the work. Nothing to do beforehand. Nothing to do afterhand.
You can re-run it with no consequences

Need to start over?

```
alienvault-reconfig -c -d -v --rebuild_db;sleep 15;perl install.pl
```

The installer will install the generators, add them to startup, and run them.  In case you want to start/stop them yourself..

```
/etc/init.d/runpcaps [start|stop|restart]
/etc/init.d/runlogs [start|stop|restart]
```
####Want to add your own pcaps?

- Add them to the `./pcaps` directory
- Done
- The IPs will be rewritten on playback to match the assets

####Want to add your own plugins/logs?
- Add them to the plugins directory.  Everything must have the same basename.  
- You can add .sql/.log/.cfg files.
- Re-run the installer

####Log Samples
Your .log files can just be copies of logs right off a system.  No need to do anything.

You can have IPs substituted for you automatically by adding a variable into your logs

**Key** | **Replaced With**
--- | ---
`<RNDIP>` | Random IP, Totally made up. No bounds.
`<OTXIP>` | IP From OTX.  Uses DB from install

#### Where are all the logfiles going?
All the generated log files are put in
`/var/log/demologs`
They will be separated by plugin.  A logrotate script for them is installed automatically.
